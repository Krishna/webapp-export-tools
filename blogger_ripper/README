A totally hacked together and messy solution for extracting blog posts from blogger.com.

## Requirements

You are going to need:
	- Python
	- The Universal FeedParser (http://feedparser.org)
	- Ruby


## Using It
	
1. Download the atom export file from your blogger.com blog.
2. Run the python script:

		python blogger_ripper.py <your atom file>
	
   This script will spew a load of output onto STDOUT. It will also product a file called dat.txt (really dont ask why its doing all this)

3. Run the ruby script:

		ruby blogger_ripper.rb data.dat
		
   This script will produce 1 file per blog entry in the current directory.

## Enhancements

Yes this whole thing needs to be sorted out properly. Ideally there would just be one Python script, but I don't know Python and right now I am not so motivated in learning it.

As these scripts are in the public domain, feel free to improve them (and lets face it, they need improvement).
